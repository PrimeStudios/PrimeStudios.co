			<h3>OUR INCEPTION</h3>
			<p>Prime Studios officially launched in December of 2019. It is here that our journey started with just one member of our team with a dream to succeed. We got a foundation and basic site down and arranged our packages and services that we would initially offer as we got the company off of it's feet.</p>
